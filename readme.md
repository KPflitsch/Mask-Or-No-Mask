1. Download coursework dataset zip file
2. Place downloaded zip file into CW_Dataset
3. Extract contents in the same directory.  
The file structure should look like the following:

```
   CW_Dataset/
    ├── test/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels/
    └── train/
        ├── images/
        └── labels/
```
4. Run Visualise_Normalize_Dataset.ipnyb and a new directory will be created called base_dataset
